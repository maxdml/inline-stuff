Test on L2 cache:
L2 specification:
256KB, 64 B cache line, 8-way associative, 512 sets

Array type: 2-dimensional
Elements: arr[1024][16] = 16384 elements
Data type: uint64_t
Total size of array: 128 KB (Half the size of L2 cache)
L2 Prefetching: disabled

All the array elements were accessed column wise for 10 iterations to see how many L2 cache references and misses were recorded.
